Simple To Do List React App

This project is developed through React library, practising React functional components or hooks instead of the component class. Mainly useState() used in this project. This simple to-do list app has been styled for better UX. It allows the user to enter a new task title, and optional notes are given for task details, removing the lists and showing the date & time after adding to the lists.

If you have any questions or issues, please let me know I would be happy to help. Happy Coding
